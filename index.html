                    <p>
                        Dispite the challenges we have faced in the past and learning from the past experiences, we can develop the nation with great innovations and ideas that create a sustainable and independent nation across the world.

                    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Have we ever imagined what is sustainability? In a small country like Bangladesh, there are a huge population in comparison to country area and most of them remain in poverty and struggles, their silent struggles really make me the feeler of their emotions.
                        So, to keep balance, we have to focus on sustainability.

                    <p>
                        To make free movement of the all kind of people, we have to ensure a better and afficient infrastructure all around the country.
                        It saves our time, transportation, costing and many other facilities effiecient for every kind of people so we should create and build a better infrastructure.

                    <p>
                        There're a lot of companies with different sizes and reputation over quality around country but still most of the youths and people are jobless, visionless and in more aimless situation.
                        So, those who are with higher knowledge and experiences, should empower the young generation, I would say to every generation.

            <p>
                The vision of our Future wholy depends on our philosophy, curiosity and interests. The vision we have now will be the destination in the future so a vision we have means a destination we have so never live without a vision.
                Let's research, find out facts and observe the overall conditions over all situations so then we can create a vision and we can aim  to have vision such and such either for our life and our community, if you have a vision for yourself that means you have a vision for your community/country and this will make our country beautiful, special, sustainable, innovative and enjoy together the freedom of our own space of inner side.

                    <p>
                        The world is developing and changing so much faster. While I was in my country (2017) at the age of 11 years, I knew nothing about digital services and the freedom of people like mobile, computer, travelling, automation, E-services and many more but as of this yera 2025, I saw so many changes in the world which made really curious and feel valued to myself that still I can learn something and do something that not only benefit me but also the community.

                    <p>
                        Green energy is one of the most use of our daily life. We use different kind of things either for personal wearing, styling, having, living etc or for household stuffs, etc but it cost and we need to work and earn then spend them on purchasing our needy stuffs.
                        But have you ever imagined about what is Green Energy? Haha, they are the sun, animals, and many more that are useful for our life and they produce a huge.

                    <h3>Modern Infrastructure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Countries like United States, Canada, European countries, UAE and some more countries have a huge buildings and different types of road infrastructure which make us really suprised and even we enjoy.
                        But in my opinion, such kind of infrastructures are really harmful and may destroy us even our life because there are natural diseases that destroy them.
                        Instead, we should focus on small and simple structure with modern ideas, innovation and save our money to support all the needy people.
